# PyBer-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze data for a ride-sharing company and obtain information about the business in urban, suburban and rural city types. Using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, the number of rides, number of drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type was compiled into a DataFrame. The total fares per week for each city type was also visualized via a line chart. 

## Results
The results of the analysis show that the highest number of rides, drivers and fares are in urban areas and the lowest number of rides, drivers and fares are in rural areas. Because of this driver scarcity in rural areas, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are the most expensive, followed by suburban areas and then urban. Below are images of the Data Frame and line chart depicting these results.

## Summary
In order to address disparities types, it is suggested that a campaign is run to recruit more drivers in suburban, and especially, rural areas. This would hopefully decrease the fare per ride, making rides more affordable and accessible for customers in these city types and encourage greater ride-share use. It is also known that because of the higher density of drivers in urban areas, the fare per ride is lower. It is suggested that the number of urban drivers is limited during busier hours to create a driver scarcity, which would increase the fare per drive and increase profits for the company. The last reccommendation involves increasing the fare price in late February, where there is a noticeable spike in profits among all city types.
